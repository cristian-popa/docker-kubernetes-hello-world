= Hello World with Docker and Kubernetes

This repo forks the Spring Boot Hello World application from arun-gupta/docker-kubernetes-hello-world . 
It simply extends the hello world to display the java version and how many CPUs the java container has at it's disposal for different java vendors. You'll need to supply your own jvms for non publicly redistributable containers such as Oracle JVM and SAP Jvm and you'd also need to modify the Dockerfiles for those files. 

Let's get started!

== CLI

=== Run App

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

=== Test Application

```
curl http://localhost:8080
```

== Docker

=== Build Application

```
mvn clean package
```

=== Build Docker Image

```
docker image build -t cristianpopa/helloworld-spring-boot:latest .
```

=== Push Docker Image

```
docker image push cristianpopa/helloworld-spring-boot:latest
```

=== Run Docker Container

```
docker container run -d --name hello-world -p 8080:8080 cristianpopa/helloworld-spring-boot:latest
```

=== Test Application

```
curl http://localhost:8080
```

=== Delete Docker Container

```
docker container rm -f hello-world
```

== Kubernetes

=== Create Deployment

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

=== Test Application

```
curl http://`kubectl get svc hello-world-service -o jsonpath={.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}`
```

=== Delete Deployment

```
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
```
